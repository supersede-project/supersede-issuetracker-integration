A list of requirements based on the JIRA dev experience

1. Ability to see the details of a Requirement/Feature
It would be good for the jira supersedeAdmin to have direct access to the requirement bound to an issue to edit its fields, start or monitor a process or anything else.
At the moment it is only possible to access the list of requirements or get the json out of a single requirement, but not visualize the requirement.
